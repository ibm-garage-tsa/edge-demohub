## Create accounts

You'll need these accounts to use the Developer Tools environment.

- [GitHub account](http://github.com) (public, not enterprise): Create one if you do not have one aleady. If you have not logged in for a while, make sure your login is working.

- [IBM Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com): Create one if needed, make sure you can log in. 

- [Katacoda Account](https://www.katacoda.com/): The account is free and easy to create.

- [RedHat Account](https://www.redhat.com/en): Needed for CodeReady Containers.


### Windows Users

Create [Linux VM](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) with the following CLI's and tools.

### Mac/Linux Users

Make sure you install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for CLI and tool installation.

## Install CLIs and tools

The following is a list of desktop tools required to help with installation and development.

- [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/): Needs to be installed in your development operating system, it comes as standard for Mac OS

- [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started): Required for management of IBM Cloud Account and management of your managed IBM Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift clusters
    - Don't install just the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli), install the [IBM Cloud CLI and Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#step1-install-idt)
    ```
    curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
    ```
    - Note: If you log in to the web UI using SSO, you'll need to [create an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-federated_id) for logging into the CLI. (You can also use this API key for [installing the Developer Tools environment](/admin/installation-ibm-cloud).)

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop): Required for building and running docker images.
    - Installed and running on your local machine

- [Tekton CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli): Used to help control Tekton
 pipelines from the command line.
    ```
        brew tap tektoncd/tools
        brew install tektoncd/tools/tektoncd-cli
    ```

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): A popular code editor
    - You will be required to edit some files, having a good quality editor is always best practice
    - Enabling [launching VSCode from a terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line)

- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html): _Optional_ installed on your local machine
    - Used for SpringBoot content

- [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/): Follow the instructions for your Operating System.
    - Make sure you have Cisco VPN turned off when using minikube

- [OpenShift CodeReady Containers (CRC)](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/#installing-codeready-containers_gsg)

### Minikube Setup 

- Verify your cluster has 4GB+ memory, and kubernetes 1.16+
    ```bash
    minikube config view
    ```
- Verify your `vm-driver` is set for `hyperkit`
    ```bash
    minikube config set vm-driver hyperkit
    ```
- In case memory is not set, or need to increase set the memory and recreate the VM
    ```bash
    minikube config set memory 4096
    minikube config set kubernetes-version v1.16.6
    minikube delete
    minikube start
    ```

    ```bash
    kubectl version
    ```
