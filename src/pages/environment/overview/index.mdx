This IBM Edge Application Manager Trial environment consists of two parts. First, is the the multi-tenant management hub running in the Openshift cluster installed in IBM Cloud. Each user gets it own tenant which is provisioned upon request. Second, is the simulated edge device running as virtual machine in IBM Cloud. If you do not have your own edge devices to connect to the management hub, you can use the provided VM to get experience with IBM Edge Application Manager.
