  To get started, you need the IBM Edge Application Manager Trial environment. To request one, follow the instructions here: [Requesting the Trial](../environment/requesting/index.mdx)

  ## Accessing the Trial environment

  There are two elements of the Trial environment:

  - instance of the IBM Edge Application Manager running on IBM Cloud (Management Hub)
  - sample virtual machine simulating the edge device (Edge node)

  When the Trial environment is provisioned you should receive the two e-mails with links and access credentials as shown below.

  - Edge node reservation e-mail

## Accessing and starting a simulated edge device

  As a part of the Trial experience you are provided with the sample simulated edge device. In case you do not have any real edge devices you can access the provided virtual machine and follow the tutorials.

  Start the environment with the Play button in the top-right corner

  ![play](images/2020-09-11-10-29-24.png)

  It takes about 2-3 minutes for the virtual machine to start


  To access the simulated edge device (the provided Ubuntu VM) you need a terminal with SSH client. On Mac or Linux workstation use a regular terminal, on Windows use Putty

  <span style="color:red">**IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE SKYTAP UI TO CONNECT TO THE MACHINE - YOU WILL USE A TERMINAL CONNECTION DIRECTLY FROM YOUR WORKSTATION**</span>

  Copy the **ssh** command provided in the reservation confirmation mail. 

  ![](images/2020-12-09-10-36-51.png)

  In above example, it is **ssh ibmuser@uscentral.demo.ibmcloud.com -p 15303**. It is the SSH port exposed from the virtal machine for your instance.

  Open the terminal on your workstation. Connect to the VM using user **ibmuser** with password **passw0rd!**

  For Mac and Linux
  ```
  ssh ibmuser@<address> -p <port>
  ```

  for example:
  ```
  ssh ibmuser@uscentral.demo.ibmcloud.com -p 15303
  ```

  For Windows use putty

  Upon sucessful login you should see the similar output

  ```sh
  $ ssh ibmuser@services-uscentral.skytap.com -p 15303
