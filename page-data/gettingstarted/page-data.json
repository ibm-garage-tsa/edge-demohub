To request one, follow the instructions here: [Requesting the Trial](https://ibm-garage-tsa.github.io/edge-demohub/environment/requesting/)\n\n  ## Accessing the Trial environment\n\n  There are two elements of the Trial environment:\n\n  - instance of the IBM Edge Application Manager running on IBM Cloud (Management Hub)\n  - sample virtual machine simulating the edge device (Edge node)\n\n  When the Trial environment is provisioned you should receive an e-mail with links and access credentials as shown below.\n\n  - Edge trial reservation e-mail\n\n  ![](images/2021-02-03-16-37-58.png)\n\n## Accessing the IBM Edge Application Manager management hub\n\n  In the email confirming the Trial reservation, there is a link to the Management hub and your access credentials.\n\n  ![](images/2021-02-03-16-22-44.png)\n\n  Open the provided link in the browser and you should see the following screen (The Trial envionment is currently using self-signed certificates so accept any warnings and cotinue accessing the website)\n\n  ![](images/2020-12-02-14-21-51.png)\n\n  Click the **Entrprise LDAP** option and login with the credentials from your e-mail.\n\n  Upon successful login, you should see the home screen of the IBM Edge Application Manager\n\n  ![](images/2021-02-02-13-01-15.png)\n\n***\n\n## Accessing the simulated edge device\n\n  As a part of the Trial experience you are provided with the sample simulated edge device. In case you do not have any real edge devices you can access the provided virtual machine and follow the tutorials.\n\n  ![](images/2021-02-03-16-20-30.png)\n\n  To access the simulated edge device (the provided Ubuntu VM) you need a terminal with SSH client. On Mac or Linux workstation use a regular terminal, on Windows use Putty\n\n  Open the terminal on your workstation. Connect to the VM using provided credentials (User and password to the hub are the same as to the virtual edge device)\n\n  For Mac and Linux\n  ```\n  ssh <user>@<address> \n  ```\n\n  for example:\n  ```\n  ssh 270xx4w3qr@169.47.95.9\n  ```\n\n  For Windows use putty\n\n  Upon sucessful login you should see the similar output\n\n  ```sh\n  $ ssh 270xx4w3qr@169.47.95.29\n  The authenticity of host '169.47.95.29 (169.47.95.29)' can't be established.\n  ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Z+ILGgBEa0XJyvoVeNfdUWzyH1nocowc1q5NzNPK+kY.\n  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes\n  Warning: Permanently added '169.47.95.29' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\n  270xx4w3qr@169.47.95.29's password: \n  Permission denied, please try again.\n  270xx4w3qr@169.47.95.29's password: \n  Permission denied, please try again.\n  270xx4w3qr@169.47.95.29's password: \n  Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-42-generic x86_64)\n\n  * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com\n  * Management:     https://landscape.canonical.com\n  * Support:        https://ubuntu.com/advantage\n\n    Get cloud support with Ubuntu Advantage Cloud Guest:\n      http://www.ubuntu.com/business/services/cloud\n\n\n  The programs included with the Ubuntu system are free software;\n  the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the\n  individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.\n\n  Ubuntu comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by\n  applicable law.\n\n  270xx4w3qr@vm-270xx4w3qr:~$\n  ```\n\n***\n\n## Running sample commands\n\nThe simulated edge device is automatically registered to the IBM Edge Application Manager Hub, and is running a sample pattern.
