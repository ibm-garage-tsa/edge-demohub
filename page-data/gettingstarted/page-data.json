To request one, follow the instructions here: [Requesting the Trial](../environment/requesting/index.mdx)\n\n  ## Accessing the Trial environment\n\n  There are two elements of the Trial environment:\n\n  - instance of the IBM Edge Application Manager running on IBM Cloud (Management Hub)\n  - sample virtual machine simulating the edge device (Edge node)\n\n  When the Trial environment is provisioned you should receive the two e-mails with links and access credentials as shown below.\n\n  - Edge node reservation e-mail\n\n  ![email-device](images/2020-12-09-10-36-51.png)\n\n  - Management hub reservation e-mail\n\n  ![email-hub](images/2020-12-09-10-36-51.png)\n\n## Accessing the IBM Edge Application Manager instance\n\n  In the email confirming the Management hub reservation, there is a link to the Management hub and your access credentials.\n\n  ![email-hub](images/2020-12-10-16-42-03.png)\n\n  Open the provided link in the browser and you should see the following screen (The Trial envionment is currently using self-signed certificates so accept any warnings and cotinue accessing the website)\n\n  ![](images/2020-12-02-14-21-51.png)\n\n  Click the **Entrprise LDAP** option and login with the credentials from your e-mail.\n\n  Upon successful login, you should see the home screen of the IBM Edge Application Manager\n\n  ![](images/2020-12-02-14-26-28.png)\n\n***\n\n## Accessing and starting a simulated edge device\n\n  As a part of the Trial experience you are provided with the sample simulated edge device. In case you do not have any real edge devices you can access the provided virtual machine and follow the tutorials.\n\n  ![](images/2020-12-09-11-20-00.png)\n\n  Click **Access Trial** button (it should open a browser) and when prompted for Virtual machine access, provide the **Desktop password** from the e-mail.\n\n  ![virtual_machine_access](images/2020-12-09-13-06-52.png)\n\n  Start the environment with the Play button in the top-right corner\n\n  ![play](images/2020-09-11-10-29-24.png)\n\n  It takes about 2-3 minutes for the virtual machine to start\n\n  ***\n\n  To access the simulated edge device (the provided Ubuntu VM) you need a terminal with SSH client. On Mac or Linux workstation use a regular terminal, on Windows use Putty\n\n  <span style=\"color:red\">**IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE SKYTAP UI TO CONNECT TO THE MACHINE - YOU WILL USE A TERMINAL CONNECTION DIRECTLY FROM YOUR WORKSTATION**</span>\n\n  Copy the **ssh** command provided in the reservation confirmation mail. \n\n  ![](images/2020-12-09-10-36-51.png)\n\n  In above example, it is **ssh ibmuser@uscentral.demo.ibmcloud.com -p 15303**. It is the SSH port exposed from the virtal machine for your instance.\n\n  Open the terminal on your workstation.
