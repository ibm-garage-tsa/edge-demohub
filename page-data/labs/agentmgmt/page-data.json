If you haven't done it yet, please complete first the [Getting Started tutorial](../gettingstarted/)\n\n***\n\n## Business Context\n\n  One of the challenges in managing edge devices is scale - there can be hundreds and thousands of devices installed in your company, in many different locations, often far from the data center. Edge nodes can be also on or off the network, which additionally impairs status visibility.\n\n  There are multiple ways to install agent on the edge device. You can explore these in more details looking at [Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKVV_4.2/installing/registration.html).\n\n  You will complete the following tasks:\n\n  - Connect to the edge device using ssh\n  -\tCreate an API key for the edge devices\n  -\tInstall agent on the edge device\n  -\tRegister the edge device with management hub\n  - Verify the registration in IBM Edge Application Manager console\n  \n***\n\n## Connecting to the simulated edge device\n\n  To access the simulated edge device (the provided Ubuntu VM) you need a terminal with SSH client. On Mac or Linux workstation use a regular terminal, on Windows use Putty.\n\n  <span style=\"color:red\">**IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE SKYTAP UI TO CONNECT TO THE MACHINE - YOU WILL USE A TERMINAL CONNECTION DIRECTLY FROM YOUR WORKSTATION**</span>\n\n  Copy the **ssh** command provided in the reservation confirmation mail. \n\n  ![](images/2020-12-09-10-36-51.png)\n\n  In above example, it is `ssh ibmuser@uscentral.demo.ibmcloud.com -p 15303`. It is the SSH port exposed from the virtal machine for your instance.\n\n  Open the terminal on your workstation. Connect to the VM using user **ibmuser** with password **passw0rd!**\n\n  For Mac and Linux\n  ```\n  ssh ibmuser@<address> -p <port> \n  ```\n\n  for example:\n  ```\n  ssh ibmuser@services-uscentral.skytap.com -p 15303 \n  ```\n\n  For Windows use putty\n\n  ![](images/2020-12-09-11-45-44.png)\n\n  Upon sucessful login you should see the similar output\n\n  ```sh\n  $ ssh ibmuser@services-uscentral.skytap.com -p 15303\n  The authenticity of host '[services-uscentral.skytap.com]:13533 ([184.170.232.54]:13533)' can't be established.\n  ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Qmebxf1haOx+zzp4gPxpB8EZ4N1YQ3rEcQK+jRj5b/Q.\n  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes\n  Warning: Permanently added '[services-uscentral.skytap.com]:15303,[184.170.232.54]:15303' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\n  ibmuser@services-uscentral.skytap.com's password: \n  Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-47-generic x86_64)\n\n  * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com\n  * Management:     https://landscape.canonical.com\n  * Support:        https://ubuntu.com/advantage\n\n  * Introducing self-healing high availability clusters in MicroK8s.\n    Simple, hardened, Kubernetes for production, from RaspberryPi to DC.\n\n      https://microk8s.io/high-availability\n\n  * Canonical Livepatch is available for installation.\n    - Reduce system reboots and improve kernel security.

Run the following commands to install the agent and register it with the IBM Edge Application Manager management hub.\n\n  ```sh\n  cd agent\n  ./agentinstall.sh\n  ```\n\n  You can verify if the agent installed successfully with the following command:\n\n  ```sh\n  hzn node list\n  ```\n\n  The output should look similar to the one shown below.\n\n  ```sh\n  ibmuser@ubuntu-virtdevice:~/agent$ hzn node list\n  {\n    \"id\": \"\",\n    \"organization\": null,\n    \"pattern\": null,\n    \"name\": null,\n    \"nodeType\": null,\n    \"token_last_valid_time\": \"\",\n    \"token_valid\": null,\n    \"ha\": null,\n    \"configstate\": {\n      \"state\": \"unconfigured\",\n      \"last_update_time\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"configuration\": {\n      \"exchange_api\": \"https://cp-console.edgetrials4-3195e5b101a2fc76b9c4875fb79cfa25-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/edge-exchange/v1/\",\n      \"exchange_version\": \"2.54.0\",\n      \"required_minimum_exchange_version\": \"2.44.0\",\n      \"preferred_exchange_version\": \"2.44.0\",\n      \"mms_api\": \"https://cp-console.edgetrials4-3195e5b101a2fc76b9c4875fb79cfa25-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/edge-css\",\n      \"architecture\": \"amd64\",\n      \"horizon_version\": \"2.27.0-173\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n***\n\n## Register the edge device with management hub\n\n  In this step you register the edge device with the management hub. To accomplish that run, the following commands in the terminal connected to your edge device:\n\n  ```sh\n  hzn register\n  ```\n\n  The output should look similar to the one shown below.\n\n  ```sh\n  Horizon Exchange base URL: https://cp-console.edgetrials4-3195e5b101a2fc76b9c4875fb79cfa25-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/edge-exchange/v1\n  Generated random node ID: 35968b9a1d84fdce72f572426349fa58ff96949c.\n  Generated random node token\n  Node dymaczew/35968b9a1d84fdce72f572426349fa58ff96949c does not exist in the Exchange with the specified token, creating/updating it...\n  node added or updated\n  Node 35968b9a1d84fdce72f572426349fa58ff96949c created.\n  No pattern or node policy is specified.

Workload agreement negotiation should begin shortly. Run 'hzn agreement list' to view.\n  ```\n\n  You can run the `hzn node list` command and compare the output. This time you should see the **\"state\": \"configured\"**\n\n***\n\n## Verify the registration\n\n  The last step is to verify the device registration in the IBM Edge Application Manager web console. Open the browser on your workstation and connect to the URL provided in the Trial confirmation e-mail.\n\n  Open the provided link in the browser and you should see the following screen (The Trial envionment is currently using self-signed certificates so accept any warnings and cotinue accessing the website)\n\n  ![](images/2020-12-02-14-21-51.png)\n\n  Click the **Entrprise LDAP** option and login with the credentials from your e-mail.\n\n  Upon successful login, you should see the home screen of the IBM Edge Application Manager\n\n  ![](images/2020-12-10-16-45-09.png)\n\n  Click the number in the **Nodes** section to see the list. Then click the device id. You should see the details of your edge device as shown below.\n\n  ![](images/2020-12-10-16-47-40.png)\n\n***\n\n## Summary\n\n  Congratulations!
